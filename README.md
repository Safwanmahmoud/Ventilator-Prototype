# Ventilator Prototype

## **Introduction**
The ventilator is a medical device used to assist the patient to breath when he is not capable of breathing on his own, whether he has a problem whith his lungs or he is under anathesia.<br />
The device has moods for working, and it should provide more than one I:E ratio option and more than one RespRate.<br />
I designed a prototype of the ventilator that can toggle between more than one I:E ratio and more than one RespRate.
